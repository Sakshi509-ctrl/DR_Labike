                  <li>Limit your access, collection, use, and sharing of personal and sensitive user data acquired through the app to purposes directly related to providing and improving the features of the app (e.g., user anticipated functionality that is documented and promoted in the app’s description on Google Play). Sharing personal and sensitive user data includes using SDKs or other third party services that cause data to be transferred to a third party. Apps that extend usage of personal and sensitive user data for serving advertising must be in compliance with our Ads Policy.</li>
                  <li>Handle all personal and sensitive user data securely, including transmitting it using modern cryptography (for example, over HTTPS).</li>

                In cases where users may not reasonably expect that their personal and sensitive user data will be required to provide or improve the policy compliant features or functionality within your app (e.g., data collection occurs in the background of your app), you must meet the following requirements:<br/><br/>

                <span className="font-bold">You must provide an in-app disclosure of your data access, collection, use, and sharing. The in-app disclosure:</span><br/>

                </p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 ml-10 space-y-2">
                  <li>Must be within the app itself, not only in the app description or on a website;</li>
                  <li>Must be displayed in the normal usage of the app and not require the user to navigate into a menu or settings;</li>
                  <li>Must describe the data being accessed or collected;</li>
                  <li>Must explain how the data will be used and/or shared;</li>
                  <li>Cannot only be placed in a privacy policy or terms of service;</li>
                  <li>Cannot be included with other disclosures unrelated to personal and sensitive user data collection.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p className="mb-6 font-bold">
                 Your in-app disclosure must accompany and immediately precede a request for user consent and, where available, an associated runtime permission. You may not access or collect any personal and sensitive data until the user consents. The app’s request for consent:                </p>
                
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 ml-10 space-y-2">
                  <li>Must present the consent dialog clearly and unambiguously;</li>
                  <li>Must require affirmative user action (e.g., tap to accept, tick a check-box);</li>
                  <li>Must not interpret navigation away from the disclosure (including tapping away or pressing the back or home button) as consent;</li>
                  <li>Must not use auto-dismissing or expiring messages as a means of obtaining user consent.</li>

                <p className="mb-6">
                To meet policy requirements, it’s recommended that you reference the following example format for Prominent Disclosure when it’s required:

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 ml-10 space-y-2">

                  <li>Example: “Call buddy collects read and write call log data to enable contact organization even when the app is not in use.”</li>

                <span className="font-bold">Data safety section</span><br/><br/>
                All developers must complete a clear and accurate Data safety section for  app detailing collection, use, and sharing of user data.

Where relevant, the section must be consistent with the disclosures made in the app’s privacy policy.

                <span className="font-bold">Privacy Policy</span><br/><br/>
                DrLaBike apps must post a privacy policy link in the designated field within Play Console, and a privacy policy link or text within the app itself. The privacy policy must, together with any in-app disclosures, comprehensively disclose how your app accesses, collects, uses, and shares user data, not limited by the data disclosed in the privacy label. This must include:

                The entity (for example, developer, company) named in the app’s Google Play store listing must appear in the privacy policy or the app must be named in the privacy policy. Apps that do not access any personal and sensitive user data must still submit a privacy policy.
